# Plan: Notebook for Columnar Storage Formats

As the lead data engineer, I've outlined a plan for a new notebook to cover the crucial topic of columnar storage formats.

### 1. Is This Concept Important?

**Yes, absolutely.** Understanding columnar storage is fundamental for any data engineer. Row-oriented formats like CSV are common for data interchange, but for analytical queries, which form the backbone of our work, columnar formats like Parquet and ORC are the industry standard.

Adding this notebook is a high-priority task. It addresses a core concept that directly impacts storage efficiency and query performance, providing significant value to our audience.

### 2. Prerequisite Topics

To ensure learners get the most out of this notebook, they should first be familiar with:

1.  **Row-Oriented Formats:** A basic understanding of formats like CSV and JSON is necessary to appreciate the benefits of columnar storage. A brief introductory notebook comparing them could be a good precursor.
2.  **Basic Data Manipulation:** Familiarity with a DataFrame library (like Pandas or Polars) is essential for the practical exercises. The existing `graph_polars.ipynb` serves as a good foundation.

### 3. Key Concepts to Address

The notebook should be structured to cover the following aspects logically:

1.  **Introduction: The "Why"**
    *   Start with a simple analogy to explain the concept.

        ### The Analogy: Two Ways to Take Notes at a Conference

        Imagine you're at a conference with 1,000 attendees. Your job is to take notes on each person: their **Name**, their **Company**, and the **Topic** they're most interested in.

        ---

        #### 1. Row-Oriented Storage: The Index Card Method

        This is the traditional way you'd take notes.

        *   You get a stack of 1,000 index cards.
        *   For the first person you meet, you take one card and write down all their information:
            *   **Card 1:** `Name: Alice | Company: Acme Inc. | Topic: AI Ethics`
        *   For the second person, you do the same on a new card:
            *   **Card 2:** `Name: Bob | Company: Beta Corp. | Topic: Data Pipelines`
        *   ...and so on for all 1,000 attendees.

        Each card is a **row**, and all the information for a single attendee is physically grouped together.

        **Now, the boss asks a question: "How many attendees are interested in 'Data Pipelines'?"**

        To answer, you have to pick up *every single one of the 1,000 cards*, read the whole card (Name, Company, and Topic), and make a tick mark if the topic is "Data Pipelines". You're forced to read through a lot of data you don't need (Names and Companies) just to find the answer.

        #### 2. Columnar Storage: The Separate Notebooks Method

        This is a completely different way to organize the same information.

        *   Instead of index cards, you have three separate, single-subject notebooks: one labeled "Names", one "Companies", and one "Topics".
        *   When you meet the first person, you write their info in the corresponding notebook on the first line of each.
            *   **Names Notebook, Line 1:** `Alice`
            *   **Companies Notebook, Line 1:** `Acme Inc.`
            *   **Topics Notebook, Line 1:** `AI Ethics`
        *   When you meet the second person, you use the second line of each notebook:
            *   **Names Notebook, Line 2:** `Bob`
            *   **Companies Notebook, Line 2:** `Beta Corp.`
            *   **Topics Notebook, Line 2:** `Data Pipelines`

        The data for a single person is now spread out, but linked by its position (line number). Each notebook is a **column**.

        **Now, the boss asks the same question: "How many attendees are interested in 'Data Pipelines'?"**

        To answer, you completely ignore the "Names" and "Companies" notebooks. You only pick up the **"Topics" notebook** and scan down that single list, counting the occurrences of "Data Pipelines".

        This is incredibly fast because you only read the exact data required to answer the question.

        ### Why It Matters for Data Engineering

        | Feature | Row-Oriented (Index Cards) | Columnar (Notebooks) |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | **Use Case** | Best for **transactional** work (OLTP). E.g., "Show me everything about Alice." You just grab her one card. | Best for **analytical** work (OLAP). E.g., "What's the average of X across all users?" You just grab the "X" notebook. |
        | **Query Speed** | Slow for queries that only need a few columns from a wide table. | Extremely fast for analytical queries that aggregate or read a subset of columns. |
        | **Compression** | Harder to compress. Data on one card is diverse (text, numbers, dates). | Highly compressible. The "Topics" notebook has lots of repeating values, which are easy to compress. |
    *   Visually illustrate the difference between how data is laid out on disk for row vs. columnar formats.

2.  **Core Advantages (The "How")**
    *   **I/O Efficiency (Column Pruning):** Demonstrate how analytical queries that select a subset of columns only read the data they need, drastically reducing I/O. This is the most important concept to land.
    *   **Compression Efficiency:** Show how grouping data of the same type (e.g., all integers, all strings) leads to much better compression ratios. Compare the file size of a dataset saved as CSV vs. Parquet.
    *   **Schema Evolution:** Briefly explain how formats like Parquet embed the schema and support its evolution, which is a common real-world challenge.

3.  **Practical Demonstration**
    *   Generate a sample dataset with a variety of data types and a significant number of columns.
    *   **Task 1 (File Size):** Write the dataset to both CSV and Parquet. Compare the resulting file sizes on disk.
    *   **Task 2 (Query Speed):** Run identical analytical queries against both files (e.g., an aggregation on one column after filtering on another). Time and compare the execution speed to highlight the performance gains.

### 4. Recommended Tools

*   **Primary Library: Polars**
    *   We should use **Polars** for this demonstration. It has native, high-performance readers for both CSV and Parquet, making the comparison direct and easy. It's also consistent with the existing `graph_polars.ipynb`.
*   **Underlying Technology: Apache Arrow**
    *   While we'll use Polars for the user-facing API, it's important to mention that **Apache Arrow** is the underlying technology that powers in-memory columnar analytics and the Parquet file format in the Python ecosystem. We should briefly explain its role as the "glue" that makes this ecosystem so efficient.
*   **Dataset:** We should use a dataset that is wider than it is long (e.g., 50 columns, 100,000 rows) to make the benefits of column pruning immediately obvious. The NYC Taxi dataset is a classic and effective choice for this.
