# Plan: Notebook for Columnar Storage Formats

As the lead data engineer, I've outlined a plan for a new notebook to cover the crucial topic of columnar storage formats.

### 1. Is This Concept Important?

**Yes, absolutely.** Understanding columnar storage is fundamental for any data engineer. Row-oriented formats like CSV are common for data interchange, but for analytical queries, which form the backbone of our work, columnar formats like Parquet and ORC are the industry standard.

Adding this notebook is a high-priority task. It addresses a core concept that directly impacts storage efficiency and query performance, providing significant value to our audience.

### 2. Prerequisite Topics

To ensure learners get the most out of this notebook, they should first be familiar with:

1.  **Row-Oriented Formats:** A basic understanding of formats like CSV and JSON is necessary to appreciate the benefits of columnar storage. A brief introductory notebook comparing them could be a good precursor.
2.  **Basic Data Manipulation:** Familiarity with a DataFrame library (like Pandas or Polars) is essential for the practical exercises. The existing `graph_polars.ipynb` serves as a good foundation.

### 3. Key Concepts to Address

The notebook should be structured to cover the following aspects logically:

1.  **Introduction: The "Why"**
    *   Start with a simple analogy: comparing a phone book (row-oriented) to an index (column-oriented) for finding all people with the last name "Smith."
    *   Visually illustrate the difference between how data is laid out on disk for row vs. columnar formats.

2.  **Core Advantages (The "How")**
    *   **I/O Efficiency (Column Pruning):** Demonstrate how analytical queries that select a subset of columns only read the data they need, drastically reducing I/O. This is the most important concept to land.
    *   **Compression Efficiency:** Show how grouping data of the same type (e.g., all integers, all strings) leads to much better compression ratios. Compare the file size of a dataset saved as CSV vs. Parquet.
    *   **Schema Evolution:** Briefly explain how formats like Parquet embed the schema and support its evolution, which is a common real-world challenge.

3.  **Practical Demonstration**
    *   Generate a sample dataset with a variety of data types and a significant number of columns.
    *   **Task 1 (File Size):** Write the dataset to both CSV and Parquet. Compare the resulting file sizes on disk.
    *   **Task 2 (Query Speed):** Run identical analytical queries against both files (e.g., an aggregation on one column after filtering on another). Time and compare the execution speed to highlight the performance gains.

### 4. Recommended Tools

*   **Primary Library: Polars**
    *   We should use **Polars** for this demonstration. It has native, high-performance readers for both CSV and Parquet, making the comparison direct and easy. It's also consistent with the existing `graph_polars.ipynb`.
*   **Underlying Technology: Apache Arrow**
    *   While we'll use Polars for the user-facing API, it's important to mention that **Apache Arrow** is the underlying technology that powers in-memory columnar analytics and the Parquet file format in the Python ecosystem. We should briefly explain its role as the "glue" that makes this ecosystem so efficient.
*   **Dataset:** We should use a dataset that is wider than it is long (e.g., 50 columns, 100,000 rows) to make the benefits of column pruning immediately obvious. The NYC Taxi dataset is a classic and effective choice for this.
